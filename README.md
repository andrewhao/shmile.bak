### Description

With your digital camera, a laptop and a printer, you can have your own DIY low-cost photobooth.

### Preparation

#### Overlay

Create your own custom overlay. Make sure it is a 4x6 crop factor, save it as a 24-bit transparent PNG. See `public/images/overlay.png` for an example.

It is recommended that this overlay image is 2400x1600px large.

When you are done, save your overlay resource into `public/images/overlay.png`.

#### Camera Tips

* Mount the camera on a steady tripod.
* It helps to set your camera on manual focus and on its lowest resolution. This reduces shutter lag time.
* Make sure your flash is charged. If it is not, the camera will wait until the flash charges before firing the shutter, making very awkward, long pauses for your guests to be smiling.

#### Printer

* Make sure your printer is set as the system default.

### Deploying/running

#### Server instance

The server is responsible for controlling the camera, and serving the Web interface that users will see.

1. Go to project root.
2. `npm install` to install the node package dependencies.
3. Install [`gphoto2`](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/gphoto2/). I'm installing with `brew`. Run `brew install gphoto2`
3. Run `coffee app.coffee` to start the server application.

#### Control interface

This is a Web browser that displays the camera control interface, and shows the visitor the real-time creation of the image. For simple deployments, this can simply be on the same computer that is running the server.

1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in a A-Grade Web browser (Chrome and Safari latest recommended).
2. If you want to use an iPad to display this interface, you'll need to have the laptop and iPad connected to the same network. Open Safari on iPad, and type in `<computer-name>:3000` to the Address Bar. Tap the `Go To` button in the Safari bar, and save the app to your home screen (see: http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/).
3. On your iPad Home Screen, open the "shmile" app you've just created.

#### Gallery interface

This is a Web browser instance that displays a view of all the generated images taken so far.

1. With the server already running on another browser instance, visit `http://localhost:3000/gallery` (or `<server_address>:3000/gallery` if you're connecting over a network)
2. If you're viewing on iPad, open the site in Safari, then save it as a Home Screen app as detailed above. Open the "gallery!" app from your home screen.
3. You should see a touchable, swipeable list of images that have already been taken. As photos are taken, the new images will be pushed to this Web view in the background.

Note: this is currently buggy and will not work if you don't have any images taken yet. Visit this view when a few photos have been generated.

### Notes

* This was developed for OS X. I cannot help you if you're attempting to run on Windows or Linux distributions.
* Note that the `PTPCamera` daemon boots up whenever you plug in your camera. Running a `killall PTPCamera` will do the trick. Shmile automatically runs this command for you when you boot up.
